    I was ________ (verb -ing) at the ________ (noun that’s a place) the other day when I heard ________ (holiday song) come on the radio. I was feeling really ________ (adjective) and I’m pretty sure I looked super ________ (adjective) because ________ (your friend) walked in and almost ________ (verb -ed). Seriously, she ________ (verb -ed) for close to ________ (amount of time)!

This time every year I ________ (verb) all the time because I get really exciting thinking about holiday ________ (plural noun)! That’s why I was sitting at the ________ (the place from up top): I was really hoping ________ (a relative) would come by and give me at least ________ (a number) pieces of holiday ________ (food item)!

That didn’t happen, but suddenly ________ (a relative) ________ (verb -ed) by in a huge________ (noun) on wheels dressed up as ________ (a singer). I know ________ (adjective) things happen around the holidays, but this didn’t make any sense! I picked up the phone to call ________ (a person), but the phone turned into a big pile of ________ (a messy food) and dripped all the way down to my ________ (a body part)!

Then my alarm clock went off for about ________ (amount of time). It was all a dream! I had a ton of ________ (a holiday food) before I went to sleep. Maybe that’s what gave me the crazy dream!
